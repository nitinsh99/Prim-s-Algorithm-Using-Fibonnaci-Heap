Prim-s-Algorithm-Using-Fibonnaci-Heap
=====================================

 This project implements Prim's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree algoritm(MST) using a simple data structure, and Fibonacci heap, also known as heap scheme. The project measures the relative performance of the two implementations. The adjacency lists representation for graphs are used for both implementations. The simple scheme uses an array to determine the next edge to include, whereas f-heap scheme uses a Finonacci heap.
